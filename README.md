sandbox - various unsupported things
=======

Just a place for me to play with JS, NodeJS, et. al.

- events : implementation of a generic event emitter
- ipauth : checks to determine if ipaddr falls within one or more CIDR subnets 
- require : simple client-side require
- runner : simple means of running async functions in series 
- stack-overflow-answers : just what it says
- util : general utility functions
